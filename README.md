# Welcome!

This will be a basic website where I will display some information about me and my current skills.

Truth to be told, I wanna learn how to code and thought "yoo, I think it would be an awesome idea to learn *HTML, CSS and JavaScript*" and now after brainstorming some first project-ideas with a friend of mine... I'm here and you're here too. 

So, please lean back and follow me on my interesting journey: 
> How the fuck do I code and how does it work properly?? 


<big> Did I catch your attention? Perfect! Then let's get started. </big>

## What I want to do

That's pretty basic tbh, but it's only a website to get the basics done soo;

1. Introduce myself

2. Talk about my first experiences with HTML and CSS

3. Fill the site with content, lol

4. Customise the site with **basic** CSS

5. Functionality for the site with JavaScript

6. <big> Finishing the project for real and don't be too lazy, lmao </big>
----
And with this I will wish myself good luck and most important <ins>**much fun!**</ins> 
I mean, after all I want to have fun while learning something new and this will make sure that I will keep going and learn new skills :)!  

So and with this being said, let's look together at this motivational "YEEE"
